# Unlocking ast-grep's powers through MCP

ast-grep (Abstract Syntax Tree Grep) offers significant untapped capabilities beyond basic pattern searching and refactoring already implemented in the ast-grep-mcp server. This report identifies the most valuable advanced features that could be exposed as additional MCP tools, complete with implementation details.

## Advanced pattern matching takes search to the next level

ast-grep's true power comes from its sophisticated pattern matching that goes far beyond simple text searches by understanding code structure through Abstract Syntax Trees.

### Meta-variable matching with constraints

ast-grep supports powerful meta-variables (placeholders that start with `$`) that can match different parts of code while maintaining structural awareness:

```
Tool Name: sgAdvancedPatternMatch
Parameters:
  - pattern: string (required) - Pattern code with meta-variables
  - language: string (required) - Target language (e.g., JavaScript)
  - metaVariables: object (optional) - Constraints for variables
  - strictness: string (optional) - Matching algorithm strictness
Returns:
  - Array of matches with captured variables and locations
```

**Example usage:** Finding all instances where a function is called with its result checked in a conditional:

```javascript
// Find all instances of "obj.val && obj.val()" for refactoring to optional chaining
const results = await sgAdvancedPatternMatch({
  pattern: "$PROP && $PROP()",
  language: "javascript"
});
```

### Contextual relationship matching

ast-grep can find code based on its relationship to surrounding code through relational rules like `inside`, `has`, `follows`, and `precedes`:

```
Tool Name: sgContextualMatch
Parameters:
  - pattern: string (required) - Base pattern to match
  - language: string (required) - Target language
  - relation: string (required) - "has", "inside", "follows", or "precedes"
  - contextPattern: string (required) - Pattern for related node
  - stopBy: string (optional) - How far to search for related nodes
Returns:
  - Array of matches with contextual information
```

**Example usage:** Finding performance issues like awaits inside loops:

```javascript
const results = await sgContextualMatch({
  pattern: "await $EXPR",
  language: "javascript",
  relation: "inside",
  contextPattern: "for ($$$) { $$$ }",
  stopBy: "end"
});
```

## Rule-based linting brings code quality enforcement

ast-grep's linting system provides customizable code quality rules with diagnostic feedback and automatic fixes.

### Rule definition and execution

```
Tool Name: sgRuleExecutor
Parameters:
  - rules: array (required) - Rule configurations
  - targetPath: string (required) - Path to analyze
  - fix: boolean (optional) - Whether to apply automatic fixes
Returns:
  - Array of issues with severity, location, and message
  - Applied fixes (if fix=true)
```

**Example usage:** Scan code with a custom rule to detect problematic patterns:

```javascript
const results = await sgRuleExecutor({
  rules: [{
    id: "no-nested-promises",
    language: "javascript",
    rule: {
      pattern: "Promise.all($A)",
      has: { pattern: "await $_", stopBy: "end" }
    },
    message: "Avoid using await inside Promise.all arguments",
    severity: "warning"
  }],
  targetPath: "./src",
  fix: false
});
```

### Rule generation from examples

```
Tool Name: sgRuleGenerator
Parameters:
  - language: string (required) - Target language

Returns:
  - Generated rule configuration
  - Test configuration for validation
```

**Example usage:** Create a rule to prevent inefficient patterns:

```javascript
const rule = await sgRuleGenerator({
  language: "typescript",
  validExamples: [
    "Promise.all([api1(), api2()])",
    "const results = await Promise.all([api1(), api2()])"
  ],
  invalidExamples: [
    "await Promise.all([await api1(), await api2()])"
  ],
  description: "Prevent await usage inside Promise.all arguments"
});
```

## Implementation considerations

To enhance the existing ast-grep-mcp server, these tools should be implemented with the following considerations:

1. **Layered architecture**: Build higher-level tools on top of more primitive ones

2. **Consistent parameter naming**: Use similar parameter names across tools for similar concepts 

3. **Clear documentation**: Each tool should have examples and explanations of its AST-based functionality

4. **Efficient resource usage**: Leverage ast-grep's parallelism capabilities while managing server resources

5. **Error handling**: Provide clear error messages for pattern syntax issues or parsing failures

## Conclusion

The capabilities outlined above represent significant enhancements to the ast-grep-mcp server that would transform it from a basic pattern searching tool into a comprehensive code analysis and transformation platform. By exposing these advanced features as MCP tools, developers would gain powerful capabilities for understanding, refactoring, and improving their codebases with the help of AI assistance.

The most valuable immediate additions would be the advanced pattern matching and batch transformation tools, as these provide capabilities that are difficult to replicate with traditional text-based approaches. Rule-based linting would also offer significant value by allowing teams to encode and enforce project-specific best practices through AI-assisted code review.
