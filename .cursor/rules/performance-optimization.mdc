# Performance Optimization

The ast-grep-mcp project includes planned performance optimizations for handling large codebases.

## Planned Optimizations (Phase 4)

1. **LRU Cache**
   - `ResultCache` class for in-memory caching of search results
   - Configurable cache size with expiration policy
   - Cache hit ratio metrics in logs

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multi-processing for directory searches
   - Worker pool for handling large file sets
   - Automatic scaling based on system capabilities

3. **Benchmarking**
   - Performance tests using pytest-bench
   - Target of â‰¥20% speed improvement on large codebases

## Implementation Status

These optimizations are scheduled for Phase 4 in the project roadmap. See [docs/implementation-plan.md](mdc:docs/implementation-plan.md) for current status and implementation details.
