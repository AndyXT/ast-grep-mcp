# Supercharging ast-grep-mcp: From experiment to production-ready tool

The ast-grep-mcp repository bridges powerful AST-based code search with AI assistants through an experimental Python MCP server implementation. While promising, this early-stage integration needs refinement to become production-ready. Here's what needs improvement and how to fix it.

## Repository state and architecture

The repository is minimal, consisting primarily of a main.py entry point that integrates ast-grep's CLI capabilities with the Model Context Protocol. It uses uv as its package manager and likely wraps ast-grep commands through Python's subprocess module in a straightforward MCP server implementation.

The current architecture follows a simple pattern where the MCP server receives natural language queries from AI clients (like Cursor), converts these to ast-grep commands, and returns the results through the MCP protocol.

## Code organization needs modularization

The current implementation appears to place most functionality in a single file, creating maintenance challenges as the project grows.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Split functionality into dedicated modules with clear responsibilities:
  ```
  /ast-grep-mcp
    /src
      main.py            # Entry point
      server.py          # MCP server configuration
      ast_grep_tools.py  # Tool implementations
      utils.py           # Helper functions
      config.py          # Configuration management
    /tests               # Test directory
    /examples            # Example usage scenarios
    /docs                # Documentation
    pyproject.toml       # Project metadata and dependencies
    README.md           
  ```
- Implement a class-based design for better encapsulation:
  ```python
  class AstGrepMCP:
      def __init__(self, config=None):
          self.config = config or self._load_default_config()
          self.server = self._init_server()
    
      def _init_server(self):
          # Initialize MCP server
          
      def register_tools(self):
          # Register ast-grep tools
          
      def start(self):
          # Start the server
  ```

## Error handling needs robustness

The experimental nature suggests limited error handling, which would be problematic for production use.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Implement structured error handling for all operations:
  ```python
  @mcp.tool()
  def search_code(pattern: str, language: str = None, directory: str = ".") -> str:
      """Search code using ast-grep pattern matching"""
      try:
          command = ["ast-grep", "-p", pattern]
          if language:
              command.extend(["-l", language])
          command.append(directory)
          
          result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
          
          if result.returncode != 0:
              log.error(f"ast-grep command failed: {result.stderr}")
              return f"Error executing ast-grep: {result.stderr}"
              
          return _format_search_results(result.stdout)
      except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
          log.error("ast-grep command timed out")
          return "Error: Command execution timed out"
      except FileNotFoundError:
          log.error("ast-grep binary not found")
          return "Error: ast-grep not installed or not in PATH"
      except Exception as e:
          log.exception("Unexpected error during code search")
          return f"Error: {str(e)}"
  ```
- Add input validation before executing commands
- Implement a logging system with configurable verbosity levels

## Performance needs optimization

The current implementation likely makes subprocess calls for each operation, which could be inefficient for repeated queries.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Implement a caching layer for recent queries:
  ```python
  class ResultCache:
      def __init__(self, max_size=100):
          self.cache = OrderedDict()
          self.max_size = max_size
          
      def get(self, key):
          if key in self.cache:
              # Move to end to mark as recently used
              value = self.cache.pop(key)
              self.cache[key] = value
              return value
          return None
          
      def put(self, key, value):
          if key in self.cache:
              self.cache.pop(key)
          elif len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
              # Remove oldest item
              self.cache.popitem(last=False)
          self.cache[key] = value
  ```
- Add parallel processing for large codebases:
  ```python
  def search_directory(pattern, directory, file_extensions=None):
      """Search a directory in parallel using multiprocessing"""
      files = _get_files_to_search(directory, file_extensions)
      with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
          results = pool.starmap(
              _search_file, 
              [(pattern, f) for f in files]
          )
      return _combine_results(results)
  ```
- Implement streaming responses for large result sets

## Documentation needs expansion

The README is minimal with basic setup instructions but lacks comprehensive details on operation and usage.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Create detailed installation and usage docs with examples:
  ```markdown
  ## Usage Examples
  
  ### Basic Code Pattern Search
  
  To search for code patterns using natural language:
  
  1. Set up the MCP server as described in the installation section
  2. In Cursor AI, ask something like:
     - "Find all functions that don't have error handling"
     - "Locate unused variables in the codebase"
     - "Find code that uses deprecated API methods"
  
  ### Language-Specific Searches
  
  To limit searches to specific languages:
  
  - "Find Python functions with more than 3 parameters"
  - "Look for JavaScript code that uses `eval`"
  ```
- Document all available tools and their parameters
- Add architecture diagrams showing the data flow between components

## Testing infrastructure is missing

There's no evidence of a testing strategy, which is critical for ensuring reliability.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Add a comprehensive test suite:
  ```python
  # test_ast_grep_tools.py
  import unittest
  from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
  from src.ast_grep_tools import search_code
  
  class TestAstGrepTools(unittest.TestCase):
      @patch('subprocess.run')
      def test_search_code_success(self, mock_run):
          # Setup mock
          mock_process = MagicMock()
          mock_process.returncode = 0
          mock_process.stdout = "file.py:10:20: match found"
          mock_run.return_value = mock_process
          
          # Call function
          result = search_code("function($ARGS)", "python", ".")
          
          # Assertions
          mock_run.assert_called_once()
          self.assertIn("match found", result)
          
      @patch('subprocess.run')
      def test_search_code_failure(self, mock_run):
          # Setup mock for failure
          mock_process = MagicMock()
          mock_process.returncode = 1
          mock_process.stderr = "Error: Invalid pattern"
          mock_run.return_value = mock_process
          
          # Call function
          result = search_code("invalid::pattern", "python", ".")
          
          # Assertions
          self.assertIn("Error", result)
  ```
- Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment
- Add integration tests with actual ast-grep commands

## uv integration can be enhanced

While uv is used as the package manager, it appears to be used in a basic way.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Define dependencies properly in pyproject.toml:
  ```toml
  [project]
  name = "ast-grep-mcp"
  version = "0.1.0"
  description = "MCP server for ast-grep integration"
  
  [project.dependencies]
  mcp-python-sdk = "^0.2.0"  # Use actual version
  pyyaml = "^6.0"
  
  [project.dev-dependencies]
  pytest = "^7.0.0"
  black = "^23.0.0"
  pylint = "^2.17.0"
  
  [build-system]
  requires = ["hatchling"]
  build-backend = "hatchling.build"
  
  [tool.hatch.scripts]
  start = "python -m ast_grep_mcp.main"
  test = "pytest"
  lint = "pylint ast_grep_mcp"
  ```
- Use uv's environment isolation capabilities for consistent execution

## Language support needs standardization

Since ast-grep supports multiple languages, the MCP server should make this more accessible.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Create language-specific tools for each supported language:
  ```python
  @mcp.tool()
  def search_python_code(pattern: str, directory: str = ".") -> str:
      """Search Python code using ast-grep pattern matching"""
      return search_code(pattern, "python", directory)
      
  @mcp.tool()
  def search_javascript_code(pattern: str, directory: str = ".") -> str:
      """Search JavaScript code using ast-grep pattern matching"""
      return search_code(pattern, "javascript", directory)
  ```
- Implement automatic language detection based on file extensions
- Provide clear documentation on which languages are fully supported

## CLI interface needs enhancement

The current interface is primarily designed for use with MCP clients rather than direct CLI usage.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Add a comprehensive CLI interface for direct usage:
  ```python
  def main():
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="ast-grep MCP server")
      parser.add_argument("--port", type=int, default=8080, help="Port to run the server on")
      parser.add_argument("--host", default="127.0.0.1", help="Host to bind the server to")
      parser.add_argument("--log-level", default="info", 
                         choices=["debug", "info", "warning", "error"], 
                         help="Logging level")
      parser.add_argument("--config", help="Path to configuration file")
      
      subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="command", help="Commands")
      
      # Start server command
      start_parser = subparsers.add_parser("start", help="Start the MCP server")
      
      # Interactive mode command
      interactive_parser = subparsers.add_parser("interactive", help="Run in interactive mode")
      
      args = parser.parse_args()
      
      # Configure logging
      logging.basicConfig(level=getattr(logging, args.log_level.upper()))
      
      if args.command == "start":
          start_server(args)
      elif args.command == "interactive":
          run_interactive_mode(args)
      else:
          start_server(args)  # Default to starting server
  ```
- Add rich terminal output with syntax highlighting

## Security needs consideration

The security implications of running arbitrary commands from MCP clients need to be addressed.

**Recommended improvements:**
- Implement input sanitization to prevent command injection:
  ```python
  def sanitize_pattern(pattern: str) -> str:
      """Sanitize ast-grep pattern to prevent command injection"""
      # Remove shell special characters and escape sequences
      sanitized = re.sub(r'[;&|><$\\`]', '', pattern)
      return sanitized
  ```
- Add file access controls to limit which directories can be accessed
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Run operations in a restricted environment

## Conclusion

The ast-grep-mcp repository provides a valuable experimental integration between ast-grep and MCP, enabling AI assistants to perform powerful code analysis. With the improvements outlined above, this tool could evolve from an experiment into a robust, production-ready solution that delivers AST-based code search capabilities to AI tools in a secure, efficient manner.

The most significant opportunities are in modularizing the codebase, enhancing error handling, improving performance through caching and parallelization, and adding comprehensive testing. These changes would transform this promising integration into a reliable tool for developers and AI assistants alike.
