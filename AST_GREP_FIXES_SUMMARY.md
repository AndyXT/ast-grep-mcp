# AST-Grep MCP Tool Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to address the issues identified in the AST-Grep MCP Tool Analysis Report.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Pattern Syntax Confusion
**Problem**: Complex patterns with metavariables like `async fn $FUNC($$) { $$ }` failed to match anything.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Updated Rust language handler with both simple and complex pattern variants
- Added comprehensive pattern syntax documentation (`/docs/pattern-syntax-comprehensive.md`)
- Enhanced pattern templates with clear examples of working patterns
- Added pattern guide tools (`get_pattern_syntax_guide`, `get_pattern_examples`, `explain_pattern`)

**Example Fix**:
```rust
// Old (didn't work)
"async_function": "async fn $NAME"

// New (works)
"async_function": "async fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) { $$$BODY }",
"async_function_simple": "async fn $NAME",  // Simpler pattern for basic matching
```

### 2. ✅ Inconsistent Pattern Validation
**Problem**: Pattern validation showed confusing error messages with unclear corrections.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced error diagnostics with clearer messages
- Added pattern-specific help based on the error type
- Improved metavariable validation to catch common mistakes early
- Added user-friendly error messages that explain $ vs $$$ usage

**Example Enhancement**:
```python
# Clear error message for common mistake
"Invalid metavariable syntax: Use $ for single capture or $$$ for multiple captures. Double dollar ($$) is not valid."
```

### 3. ✅ Token Limit Errors
**Problem**: `analyze_dependencies` and `generate_review_report` failed with token limit errors.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added pagination support to `analyze_dependencies` method
- Added pagination support to `generate_review_report` method
- Implemented `summary_only` mode for review reports
- Added automatic result truncation for large datasets

**API Changes**:
```python
# analyze_dependencies now supports pagination
analyze_dependencies(directory, language, analyze_external=True, page=1, page_size=None)

# generate_review_report now supports pagination and summary mode
generate_review_report(directory, output_format="markdown", ..., summary_only=False, page=1, page_size=None)
```

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Pattern Builder
**Problem**: Pattern builder didn't generate complete patterns based on options.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced `PatternBuilder` class with more options for functions
- Added support for `with_args`, `with_body`, `with_return` parameters
- Implemented language-specific pattern builders (async functions, arrow functions, etc.)
- Added comprehensive pattern building for complex scenarios

**New Features**:
```python
# Enhanced function pattern building
builder.function(name="myFunc", with_args=True, with_body=True, with_return="Result<T, E>")

# New pattern types
builder.async_function()
builder.arrow_function(is_async=True, with_block=True)
builder.jsx_element(component="Button", self_closing=True)
```

### 5. ✅ Security Audit Improvements
**Problem**: Security audit found 0 issues despite code having unwrap() calls.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive enhanced security rules (`/rules/rust-security-enhanced.yaml`)
- Added 30+ new security rules for Rust covering:
  - Error handling (unwrap, expect, panic)
  - Memory safety (unsafe blocks, raw pointers)
  - Concurrency issues
  - Security vulnerabilities (command/SQL injection, path traversal)
  - Cryptography issues
  - Resource management
  - Common antipatterns
- Updated security audit to use enhanced rules

**New Security Checks**:
- `unwrap-usage`: Detects all unwrap() calls
- `expect-usage`: Warns about expect() usage
- `panic-usage`: Prevents panic! in production
- `unsafe-block`: Flags unsafe code for review
- `hardcoded-credentials`: Detects hardcoded secrets
- And many more...

### 6. ✅ Pattern Documentation and Help
**Problem**: Lack of clear pattern syntax documentation.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive pattern syntax guide
- Added pattern guide tools accessible via MCP:
  - `get_pattern_syntax_guide`: Shows metavariable syntax and principles
  - `get_pattern_examples`: Provides language-specific examples
  - `explain_pattern`: Explains what a pattern matches
- Integrated pattern help into error messages

### 7. ✅ Improved Language Pattern Templates
**Problem**: Default patterns were too simple or didn't work.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Updated all language handlers with working pattern templates
- Added both simple and complex variants for flexibility
- Included patterns for common use cases:
  - Async patterns (async/await, spawn, futures)
  - Error handling patterns
  - Security-sensitive patterns
  - Common antipatterns

## Additional Improvements

### Pattern Testing
- Added pattern validation before execution
- Improved error messages with suggested corrections
- Added pattern simplification for failed matches

### Performance
- Pagination prevents memory issues with large codebases
- Response size limits prevent token overflow
- Efficient pattern matching with native AST-grep API

## Usage Examples

### Finding Unwrap Calls (Now Works!)
```python
# This now successfully finds unwrap() calls
result = search_directory("/path/to/rust/code", "$EXPR.unwrap()", file_extensions=[".rs"])
```

### Running Security Audit (Now Comprehensive!)
```python
# Detects unwrap(), panic!, unsafe blocks, and more
audit = run_security_audit("rust", "/path/to/code")
```

### Building Complex Patterns
```python
# Generate complete async function pattern
pattern = build_pattern("function", "rust", {
    "name": "process_data",
    "async": True,
    "with_args": True,
    "return_type": "Result<Data, Error>"
})
# Returns: "async fn process_data($$$PARAMS) -> Result<Data, Error> { $$$BODY }"
```

### Getting Pattern Help
```python
# Get syntax guide
guide = get_pattern_syntax_guide(topic="metavariables", language="rust")

# Get pattern examples
examples = get_pattern_examples("async", "rust")

# Explain a pattern
explanation = explain_pattern("$EXPR.unwrap()", "rust")
```

## Summary

All critical issues from the analysis report have been addressed:
- ✅ Pattern syntax is now well-documented with working examples
- ✅ Pattern validation provides clear, actionable error messages
- ✅ Token limit errors are prevented with pagination
- ✅ Pattern builder generates complete, working patterns
- ✅ Security audit now catches all common issues including unwrap()
- ✅ Comprehensive pattern documentation is available
- ✅ Language templates include working patterns for all common cases

The tool is now significantly more user-friendly and effective at finding code patterns and security issues.
