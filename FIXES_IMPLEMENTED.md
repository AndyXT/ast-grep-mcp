# AST-GREP MCP Fixes Implemented

Based on your testing feedback, I've implemented the following fixes:

## üî¥ Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Pattern Syntax Confusion ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Confusing error messages about `$` vs `$$` vs `$$$`

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive pattern syntax guide: `/docs/pattern-syntax-guide.md`
- Added pattern normalization that automatically fixes `$$` to `$`
- Clear documentation: Use `$NAME` for single captures, `$$$NAME` for multiple
- Added Rust-specific pattern cookbook: `/docs/rust-pattern-cookbook.md`

### 2. Silent Failures ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Operations return empty results without explanation

**Solution**:
- Added `debug_info` field when no matches are found
- Enhanced logging to show what pattern was actually used
- Added pattern suggestions based on language and pattern type
- Shows number of files searched even when no matches found

### 3. Language Feature Support ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Failed to recognize Rust async functions with parameters

**Root Cause**: Rust patterns in ast-grep don't support `$$$PARAMS` for function parameters

**Solution**:
- Updated Rust language handler with working patterns
- Use `async fn $NAME` instead of `async fn $NAME($$$PARAMS)`
- Created pattern cookbook with working examples
- Added clear documentation about this limitation

### 4. Error Handling Improvements ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Cryptic errors and AttributeErrors

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handler to catch AttributeErrors and show available methods
- Added method suggestions using fuzzy matching
- Better error messages with links to documentation
- Fixed pattern normalization to prevent common mistakes

### 5. Pattern Validation & Debugging ‚úÖ
**Problem**: No clear indication if patterns are valid

**Solution**:
- Added debug info in responses showing:
  - Pattern actually used (after normalization)
  - Number of files searched
  - Language-specific suggestions
  - Pattern help based on common mistakes

## üìö Documentation Added

1. **Pattern Syntax Guide** (`/docs/pattern-syntax-guide.md`)
   - Clear explanation of metavariable syntax
   - Language-specific examples
   - Common mistakes to avoid

2. **Rust Pattern Cookbook** (`/docs/rust-pattern-cookbook.md`)
   - Working patterns for Rust
   - Examples of what doesn't work
   - Recommended approaches

3. **Demo Scripts**
   - `examples/rust_async_functions_demo.py` - Shows correct usage
   - `examples/debug_rust_patterns.py` - Pattern testing tool

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Changes

### Language Handler Updates
```python
# Before (WRONG):
"async_function": "async fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) { $$$BODY }"

# After (CORRECT):
"async_function": "async fn $NAME"
```

### Pattern Normalization
- Automatically converts `$$` to `$` (common typo)
- Logs when patterns are modified
- Preserves `$$$` for valid multi-captures

### Debug Information
When no matches are found:
```json
{
  "matches": {},
  "debug_info": {
    "pattern_used": "async fn $NAME",
    "files_searched": 15,
    "suggestion": "No matches found. Check pattern syntax...",
    "rust_tip": "For Rust: use 'async fn $NAME' not 'async fn $NAME($$$PARAMS)'"
  }
}
```

## üéØ Correct Usage Examples

### Finding Async Functions in Rust
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
pattern = "async fn $NAME"
pattern = "pub async fn $NAME"

# ‚ùå WRONG
pattern = "async fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) { $$$BODY }"
```

### Finding Function Calls
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
pattern = "$EXPR.unwrap()"
pattern = "connect_to_scanner"

# ‚ùå WRONG  
pattern = "fn $NAME($$PARAMS)"
```

## üîß Remaining Work

1. **YAML Parsing in Security Rules**: The YAML format is correct, but there might be issues with how rules are loaded. This needs further investigation.

2. **Full AST Parameter Matching**: Due to ast-grep limitations, complex parameter matching in Rust isn't possible. This is documented as a known limitation.

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with exact matches or simple patterns
2. **Use Pattern Cookbook**: Reference the language-specific cookbooks
3. **Check Debug Info**: When no matches found, check the debug_info field
4. **Test Patterns**: Use the debug scripts to test patterns before using in production

The tool now provides much better feedback and documentation to avoid the confusion you experienced.
