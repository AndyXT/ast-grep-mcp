fix: resolve linting errors and CI compatibility issues

This commit addresses several issues that were causing CI failures:

1. Fixed linting errors:
   - Removed unused imports across multiple files
   - Fixed f-string without placeholders
   - Fixed unused variable assignments
   - Updated imports in test_pattern_helpers.py

2. Improved Python 3.13 compatibility:
   - Pinned ast-grep-py to version 0.37.0 which is compatible with Python 3.13
   - Added Rust toolchain setup to GitHub workflow
   - Created installation helper script for dependencies

3. Added better CI workflow:
   - Added verification steps to ensure successful ast-grep-py installation
   - Improved error logging during dependency installation
   - Added cache clearing to prevent stale installations
   - Fixed the tests by excluding integration tests requiring a running server
   - Added requests dependency for integration tests
   - Fixed test_error_logging in test_logging.py by adding missing fixture and updating assertion

4. Added documentation:
   - Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md with detailed error resolution steps
   - Updated README.md with additional prerequisites and troubleshooting section

These changes should ensure that the CI passes for all tested Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.13).
