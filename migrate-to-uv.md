# Supercharging Python MCP servers with uv: the blazing-fast package manager

Python's Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and resources. When these servers incorporate ast-grep for code analysis capabilities, they become powerful tools for manipulating and understanding codebases. Switching from pip to uv as your package manager for such projects can dramatically improve performance and dependency management. This guide explains how to integrate uv into your Python MCP server that uses ast-grep, what advantages you'll gain, and practical examples to make the transition smooth.

## Why uv transforms Python dependency management

uv is a lightning-fast Python package manager written in Rust that offers dramatic improvements over pip. For MCP servers, which often have complex dependency requirements, uv provides several key advantages:

**10-100x faster performance** means environment setup and dependency resolution happens in seconds instead of minutes, dramatically speeding up development and CI/CD workflows. A process that took 20 seconds with pip can now complete in 1 second or less with uv, making environment recreation nearly instant.

Beyond raw speed, uv provides a unified toolchain replacing multiple Python tools (pip, virtualenv, pip-tools, etc.) into a single, coherent system with superior dependency resolution using the PubGrub algorithm, which identifies conflicts with clearer error messages.

## Understanding your MCP server structure

A typical Python MCP server that uses ast-grep has a structure similar to:

```
my-mcp-server/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml          # Project metadata and dependencies
├── mcp.json                # MCP server configuration
└── src/
    └── my_server/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── __main__.py     # Entry point
        ├── server.py       # MCP server implementation
        └── tools/
            └── ast_grep_tools.py  # ast-grep integration
```

The server likely uses the FastMCP framework with ast-grep for code analysis:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from ast_grep_py import SgRoot

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Code Analyzer", dependencies=["ast-grep-py", "other-dependencies"])

@mcp.tool()
def search_code_pattern(code: str, pattern: str) -> str:
    """Search for a pattern in the provided code."""
    root = SgRoot(code, "python")
    node = root.root()
    results = node.find_all(pattern=pattern)
    return "\n".join([r.text() for r in results])
```

## Installing uv and transitioning from pip

Let's start by installing uv:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows PowerShell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | iex
```

After installation, confirm it's working:

```bash
uv --version
```

## Modifying your project to use uv

### Step 1: Create or update pyproject.toml

If you're starting from scratch or don't have a pyproject.toml yet:

```bash
# Initialize a new project with uv
uv init my-mcp-server
cd my-mcp-server
```

For an existing project, you can migrate your pip-based dependencies:

```bash
# Convert a requirements.txt file to pyproject.toml format
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

Here's an example pyproject.toml for an MCP server that uses ast-grep:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-mcp-server"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An MCP server using ast-grep for code analysis"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "mcp>=1.7.0",
    "ast-grep-py>=0.37.0",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

# Development dependencies
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=24.0.0",
    "ruff>=0.5.0",
]

# Optional features
[project.optional-dependencies]
extra-languages = [
    "tree-sitter-lua>=0.0.14",
    "tree-sitter-go>=0.20.0",
]
```

### Step 2: Create and manage your virtual environment

uv automatically creates virtual environments when needed:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment with the default Python
uv venv

# Or specify a Python version
uv venv --python 3.11
```

### Step 3: Managing dependencies with uv

Instead of using pip commands, you'll now use uv:

```bash
# Add a dependency
uv add requests

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev pytest

# Remove a dependency
uv remove requests

# Install all dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Install including development dependencies
uv sync --dev
```

When adding a package, uv automatically:
1. Updates the dependencies list in your pyproject.toml
2. Updates the uv.lock file (similar to requirements.txt)
3. Syncs your environment with the new dependencies

## Running your MCP server with uv

To run your MCP server with uv, you need to modify your MCP configuration. A typical MCP configuration that uses uv would look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-code-analyzer": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", "/path/to/my-mcp-server",
        "run", "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration:
- The `command` is set to `uv` instead of `python`
- The `--directory` flag specifies your project directory
- `run` tells uv to execute the script in your project environment
- `server.py` is your server's entry point

Using `uv run` ensures your server runs in a consistent environment that matches your locked dependencies.

## Sample MCP server implementation

Here's an implementation example of a Python MCP server that uses ast-grep with uv:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from ast_grep_py import SgRoot

# Create a server with uv-compatible dependencies specification
mcp = FastMCP("Code Analyzer")

@mcp.tool()
def search_pattern(code: str, pattern: str) -> str:
    """Search for a pattern in the provided code."""
    root = SgRoot(code, "python")
    node = root.root()
    results = node.find_all(pattern=pattern)
    return "\n".join([r.text() for r in results])

@mcp.tool()
def refactor_code(code: str, find_pattern: str, replace_pattern: str) -> str:
    """Refactor code by replacing patterns."""
    root = SgRoot(code, "python")
    node = root.root()
    matches = node.find_all(pattern=find_pattern)
    # This is a simplified example - actual implementation would use ast-grep's replace functionality
    result = code
    for match in reversed(matches):  # Process in reverse to maintain positions
        start, end = match.range()
        result = result[:start] + replace_pattern + result[end:]
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Updating CI/CD workflows for uv

If you're using GitHub Actions, here's how to update your workflow to use uv:

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up UV
      uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5
      with:
        version: "0.7.2"
        enable-cache: true
        
    - name: Set up Python
      run: uv python install 3.10
      
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: uv sync --locked --all-extras --dev
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: uv run pytest tests/
```

## Managing multiple language dependencies

While uv focuses on Python packages, your MCP server project might interact with code in multiple languages. Here's how to handle multi-language dependencies effectively:

### 1. Using language-specific binding tools

For each language combination, use specialized binding tools alongside uv:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # Core Python dependencies
    "mcp>=1.7.0",
    "ast-grep-py>=0.37.0",
    
    # Python bindings for other languages
    "lupa>=2.0",  # For Lua
    "cffi>=1.16.0",  # For C
    "gopy>=0.4.0",  # For Go
]
```

### 2. Separating build concerns

Use a higher-level build system like Make to orchestrate multi-language builds:

```makefile
.PHONY: setup test run

setup:
	# Set up Python environment
	uv sync --dev
	
	# Set up Rust components
	cd rust_components && cargo build
	
	# Set up Go components
	cd go_components && go build

test:
	uv run pytest
	cd rust_components && cargo test
	cd go_components && go test ./...

run:
	uv run server.py
```

### 3. Containerization

For complex multi-language setups, consider Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install uv
RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install other language toolchains
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    rustc \
    cargo \
    golang

WORKDIR /app

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Install Python dependencies with uv
RUN uv sync --locked

# Build other language components
RUN make setup

# Run the server
CMD ["uv", "run", "server.py"]
```
